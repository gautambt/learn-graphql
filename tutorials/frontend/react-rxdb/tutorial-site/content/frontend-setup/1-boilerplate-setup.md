## Boilerplate

The boilerplate for this app can be downloaded and run as follows:

git clone https://github.com/hasura/rxdb-hasura-demo.git
git checkout boilerplate
Update auth0 configuration in src/components/auth0-variables.js
Run npm install
Run npm start

At this point, you will be able to login, and see an empty todo list, but you wonâ€™t be able to add any todos. That is because the functionality required to add a todo to a store, fetch todos from the store, etc has been left unimplemented in the boilerplate.
